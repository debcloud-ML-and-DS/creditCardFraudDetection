## Objective
The Aim of this project was to build a model to predict fraud in credit card.

## Steps
* Performed exploratory data analysist.
* Preprocess on ma training dataset only.
* Build model.
* Made Predictions.
* Perform Hyper parameter tuning.
* Saved model.

## Algorithms used to experiment
* Naive Bayes
* Logistic Regression
* KNN
* RandomForestClassifier
* DecisionTreeClassifier

The model with the highest performance was the one built using RandomForestClassifier and Decision Tree.
Any other information can be found or located in the notebook the model was built.
